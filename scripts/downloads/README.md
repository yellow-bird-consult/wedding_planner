# Downloads

To download we run one of the download scripts. Once it's downloaded we can do the following to extract it:

```
tar xzf wedp-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz -O > wedp
chmod +x ./wedp 
```

for github actions we can follow [this](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/fetch-github-release-asset) tutorial.
